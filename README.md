## Comparative Analysis of CNN and MobileNetV2 in the Diagnosis of Dermatological Infections

Skin infections caused by bacterial, fungal, parasitic, and viral pathogens remain a global health concern, requiring timely and accurate diagnosis for effective treatment. Manual assessment is often time-consuming and inconsistent, motivating the development of automated computer vision solutions. This study addresses the classification of eight skin diseases: Bacterial Infections – cellulitis, Bacterial Infections – impetigo, Fungal Infections – athlete’s foot, Fungal Infections – nail fungus, Fungal Infections – ringworm, Parasitic Infections – cutaneous larva migrans, Viral Infections – chickenpox, and Viral Infections – shingles. A curated dataset was enhanced using offline augmentation techniques, including random rotation (±20°), horizontal flipping, width and height shifts (±10%), shear transformations, and zoom adjustments, with pixel gaps filled using nearest-neighbor interpolation. These steps ensured improved data diversity and balanced representation across classes. All images were standardized to a resolution of 224×224 pixels. Two deep learning models were implemented: a baseline Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a MobileNetV2 transfer learning approach pretrained on ImageNet. Both models were trained for 25 epochs and evaluated using accuracy, confusion matrix, and classification report metrics. Experimental results demonstrated that MobileNetV2 attained a test accuracy of 97.0%, surpassing the baseline CNN’s 82.8%, thereby confirming the effectiveness of transfer learning in capturing complex dermatological features.
This work demonstrates that lightweight, pretrained architectures combined with systematic augmentation strategies can deliver near-clinical accuracy for multi-class skin disease diagnosis, marking a significant advancement toward AI-assisted dermatology.
